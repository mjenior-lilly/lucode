"""Resolve the effective agent settings from the managed config plus local lucode state.

The admin-authored manifest (``~/.lucode/managed-state.json``, written by
:mod:`lucode.managed_config`) and the developer's own lucode state (``~/.lucode/state.json``) stay
separate files — they are never merged on disk. This module resolves them at config-write time:
manifest values win, while omitted values fall back to the developer's lucode state. The resolved
view is rendered into Pi or OpenCode configuration without rewriting either state file.

Only settings recorded through lucode participate in this fallback. Agent configuration maintained
outside lucode is owned by the agent and is not read here.

Everything here is pure: no I/O, no mutation of the inputs. Fetching and persisting the manifest,
and handing the resolved state to the agent config writers, live in :mod:`lucode.managed_config`.
