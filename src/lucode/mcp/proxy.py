"""`lucode mcp-proxy`: a stdio MCP server that bridges to a Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint, injecting an OAuth or explicitly activated PAT bearer.

Every coding agent lucode configures points its Databricks MCP servers at this
one command (``lucode mcp-proxy --url <endpoint> --profile <profile>``) as a
local **stdio** server. The agent spawns and reaps the proxy as a child process
— lucode owns no long-lived process and no background refresh thread. The proxy
speaks stdio to the agent and streamable-HTTP to Databricks. An ``httpx.Auth``
hook uses the normal token path on every upstream request, refreshing OAuth as
needed or reusing the PAT exported once before preflight.

This replaces the previous per-client header auth (static ``Bearer
${OAUTH_TOKEN}`` and per-client token rewrites): one uniform mechanism, token
refresh in a single place, and the proxy is an invisible implementation detail
baked into each client's config.

Auth failures are terminal and are reported *fast*. When OAuth cannot mint a
token or explicit PAT activation fails, the proxy prints an actionable,
non-secret message to stderr and exits ``AUTH_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE`` rather than
letting the client wait out its MCP startup timeout. Every server registered
against the same profile fails at once in that state, so a silent hang is
especially confusing -- the user needs to be told to re-run
``databricks auth login``.
