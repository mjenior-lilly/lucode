"""Admin-authored managed coding-agent config: fetch, normalize, and local persistence.

An org admin authors a ``CodingAgentConfig`` through the Databricks AI Gateway; developers read it
(non-admin) and ``ucode`` applies it locally. This module owns the developer-read half:

- fetching the raw manifest (via :func:`ucode.databricks.managed.fetch_managed_coding_agent_configs`),
- normalizing the proto-JSON into a stable internal dict keyed by ucode's own tool names,
- persisting it to ``~/.ucode/managed-state.json`` (0600), and
- re-reading it on each launch, falling back to the persisted copy when the read fails.

:func:`refresh_managed_config` is the launch path's entry point. It is called before model discovery,
because the manifest decides whether that discovery is needed at all; the launch path then hands the
manifest to :func:`ucode.managed_resolve.resolve_state` once the state it layers over is final.
Deciding *which* value wins for a given key is :mod:`ucode.managed_resolve`'s job, kept separate so
that logic stays pure and I/O-free.
